		<h2>Reflecting on Assignment 1 9/30/2021</h1>
    
    <p>
    Looking back our first assignment was quite simple. I was mostly.
    learning HTML syntax as I went. Conceptually I already understood alot
    </p> 
    <p>
    about html however in
    practice I hadn't touched it much before. I was able to pick HTML up pretty quickly
    and had index.html done in no time.
    </p> 
    <p>
    Blog.html went practicly the same as it didn't any sort of new concepts.
    This assignment definatly has me excited the assignments going forward.
    </p>
	    
    <h2>Reflecting on Assignment 2 10/23/2021</h2>
    
    <p>Assignment 2 was the first cs project I've worked on in osu that actually </p>
    <p>felt like I was making something of real value. css was a small challenge as</p>
    <p>I was very unfamiliar with everything I was doing. I found css to be pretty fun</p>
    <p>though so I think thathelped me figure everything out on my own. I think given more</p>
    <p>time CSS is something I could sit down and toy with on my own for a long time.</p>
