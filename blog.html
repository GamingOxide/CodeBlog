		<h2>Reflecting on Assignment 1 9/30/2021</h1>
    
    <p>
    Looking back our first assignment was quite simple. I was mostly.
    learning HTML syntax as I went. Conceptually I already understood alot
    </p> 
    <p>
    about html however in
    practice I hadn't touched it much before. I was able to pick HTML up pretty quickly
    and had index.html done in no time.
    </p> 
    <p>
    Blog.html went practicly the same as it didn't any sort of new concepts.
    This assignment definatly has me excited the assignments going forward.

    <h2>Reflecting on Assignment 2 10/23/2021</h2>
    
    <p>Assignment 2 was the first cs project I've worked on in osu that actually </p>
    <p>felt like I was making something of real value. css was a small challenge as</p>
    <p>I was very unfamiliar with everything I was doing. I found css to be pretty fun</p>
    <p>though so I think thathelped me figure everything out on my own. I think given more</p>
    <p>time CSS is something I could sit down and toy with on my own for a long time.</p>

    <h2>Reflecting on Assignment 3 10/27/2021</h2>
    
    <p>Having previous experience with javascript this assignment was the easiest for me so far.</p>
    <p>When I first started to teach my self how to programm I used Java and Python.</p>
    <p>Java over time became less usefull to me as game design became my focus and c++ became </p>
    <p>more standard for my projects. Java still has always seemed more comprehensible, but I've never</p>
    <p>gone far enough with the language to know for sure if I'd always think that.</p>

    <h2>Reflecting on Assignment 4 11/15/2021</h2>
    
    <p>Assignment 4 as short as it might have been was the type of project I was interested in along time ago.</p>
    <p>During my senior year I started my senior project with intention of taking a video game I had made in Unreal</p>
    <p>engine and using a server for network play. I had a mentor and budget set out but due to covid the project got canceled.</p>
    <p>Even though assignment 4 is very different from what I would have designed It still feels like a small taste of</p>
    <p>what I was interested in learning around 2-3 years ago.</p>
	
    <h2>Reflecting on Assignment 5 12/1/2021</h2>
    
    <p>Assignment 5 started out as one of the most confusing assignment and ended as my favorite assignment.</p>
    <p>I was very lost during our lectures and even though I was attempting to follow along in VScode I wasn't really</p>
    <p>grasping onto the new information. However after going home and taking my time with lecture notes, example code and </p>
    <p>the lecture recordings I was able to figure everything out. I feel like alot of the concepts here will persist to be usefull</p>
    <p>even in other languages and areas of Computers Science so I'm glad to have an understanding of the new material.</p>
