    <p>
    Looking back our first assignment was quite simple. I was mostly.
    learning HTML syntax as I went. Conceptually I already understood alot
    </p> 
    <p>
    about html however in
    practice I hadn't touched it much before. I was able to pick HTML up pretty quickly
    and had index.html done in no time.
    </p> 
    <p>
    Blog.html went practicly the same as it didn't any sort of new concepts.
    This assignment definatly has me excited the assignments going forward.
    </p>
